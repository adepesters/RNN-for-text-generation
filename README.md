In this project, I generate text using a multi-layered recurrent neural network (RNN) built and trained with Tensorflow. As a dataset, I use the scripts from the first 8 seasons from the TV show Friends. 

The dataset was downloaded from: http://www.livesinabox.com/friends/scripts.shtml. 

Note: This project currently only works with Tensorflow 1.1.

This is an adaptation of a project carried out in the context of the Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation by Udacity.
